                        <p class="leftp"><a href="#"><b> The Second Punic War </b></a>(218–201 BC) was the second of
                            three wars fought between Carthage and Rome, the two main powers of the western
                            Mediterranean in the 3rd century BC. For 17 years the two states struggled for supremacy.
                            After immense materiel and human losses on both sides the Carthaginians were defeated.
                            Macedonia, Syracuse and several Numidian kingdoms were drawn into the fighting, and Iberian
                            and Gallic forces fought on both sides. There were three main military theatres during the
                            war: Italy, where Hannibal defeated the Roman legions repeatedly, with occasional subsidiary
                            campaigns on the islands of Sicily and Sardinia and in Greece; Iberia, where Hasdrubal, a
                            younger brother of Hannibal, defended the Carthaginian colonial cities with mixed success
                            before moving into Italy; and North Africa, where Rome finally won the war. A peace treaty
                            stripped the Carthaginians of all overseas territories, and prohibited them from waging war
                            outside Africa. (This article is part of a featured topic: Punic Wars.)
